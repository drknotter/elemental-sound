# Elemental Sound
Ever wondered what argon sounds like? How about rubidium or ionized uranium? After watching Minute Physic's [The Sound of Hydrogen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyi5SvPlMXc) video and the accompanying [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhvW8yZdE5A), I decided to replicate their results, but also fill in the rest of the periodic table. I wrote a Python script to scrape the data from the NIST website, wrote a MatLab script to generate the sounds from that, and then encapsulated it all into what you see here.
